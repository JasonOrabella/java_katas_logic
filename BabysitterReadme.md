For the babysitter Kata I started the Hours at 0, the babysitter can not start before 5pm. So 5pm (17:00) is 
0 0 while 6pm is 1, and so on. The ending time limit is 11 which is 4 am. I tried to make variables that were easy to read and understand.

I tried to accomplish this kata using nested "if else "statements because this isnt an approach i could find for this problem that was already on github.

If the times were out of the times parameters it should set the wage to 0
